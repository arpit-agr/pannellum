  description: "A 360 degree panorama of the VLT in operation at ESO's Paranal Observatory. Visible are the Unit and Auxiliary Telescopes that make up the VLT, underneath the exquiste dark Chilean skies that brought ESO to the remote observatory. The bright yellow lines shining up into the sky are lasers used by the telescope's adaptive optics system to compensate for the blurring effects of Earth's atmosphere."
